Windows:
There is no official Windows binary distribution of pygraphviz, which is needed for SVG
rendering of the variant graph. To add SVG support in Windows, before doing the above, 
install an "unofficial" Windows pygraphviz binary from the link at 
http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/, along with the main Graphviz file at the link
provided there. Then add the path to the graphviz installation (specifically, to dot.exe) 
to the system path.

When using IPython Notebook a nice HTML representation of the alignment table is shown when the collate function is called.


Output can also be shown as a graph instead of a table when graphviz and pygraphviz are installed:
::

  collate(collation, output="graph")
